    <p>Gene regulatory networks are commonly used by many biologists to explain the interactions among genes, proteins and other components at the intra-cellular level. State diagrams or finite state machines can be used for describing the behavior of gene network dynamics. However, when they are used to model large and complex systems, determining the states and transitions among them can be overwhelming, due to their flat, unstratified structure. Professor Yong Jun-Shin has published an article regarding the use of statecharts, which supports modular, hierarchical, and concurrent features, to model complex gene network dynamics. The goal of this independent study is to develop statecharts as web services for gene network modeling and this project will be available to public as an open-source repository on GitHub. This project uses ASP.NET Web API 2 from Microsoft .NET along with the Microsoft Azure Education free account to host web services for simple gene network, feedforward loops, mutual negative and positive feedback loops. In addition to these services, this project will provide client applications which use JQuery.</p>
